## questions

1. What's one thing that you see me doing or failing to do that's getting in my own way?
2. What's one thing I could change that would make a difference to you?

**If you keep hearing something over and over again, it's probably true and it's sth you should act on.**
Give it a shot for a week and see what happens.

## feedback at work

- It's your work, own getting feedback
- Have a designated facilitator
- Have critique goals (and non-goals)
- Separate like/hate from good/bad
- Avoid too many people (5-6 is ok)

## delivering feedback

- donâ€™t sugar coat it
- humor can help
- be factual
- try to question yourself on memes or others emotions
- check yourself on any bias you might be carrying
- feedback when emotional can work, but counting to 10 always seems to be a good thing
- wait for the emotion to subside

# How to win friends and influence people (based on the book by Dale Carnegie)

Donâ€™t criticize, condemn or complain.

Give honest and sincere appreciation.

## Arouse in the other person an eager want

You are interested in what you want. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we want. So the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.

If for example you don't want someone to smoke, don't preach them and don't talk about what you want;

We all started finger-painting on the kitchen table - my wife, Lil, my other son Bob, and myself, all having fun. Soon Tim was peeping around the corner. Next he was begging to participate. "Oh, no! You have to go to kindergarten first to learn how to fingerpaint."

If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own.

First, arouse on the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.

## To make people like you

### Become genuinely interested in other people.

You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.

### Smile.

### Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.

### Be a good listener

Sometimes be "hearty in approbation and lavish in praise".

People fail to make a favorable impression because they don't listen attentively. "They have been so much concerned with what they are going to say next that they do not keep theirs ears open.

Important people prefer good listeners to good talkers, but the ability to listen seems rarer than almost any other good trait.

### Encourage others to talk about themselves.

### Talk in terms of the other person's interests.

### Always make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely

Desire to be important is the deepest urge in human nature.

Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.

Express honest admiration for others hobby and interests to get something from them.

Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours.

## To win people to your way of thinking

### The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it

**You can't win an argument.**

> If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent's good will. ~Benjamin Franklin

Look for areas of agreement. When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which you agree. Be honest. Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness.

Promise to think over your opponents' ideas and study them carefully. And mean it. Your opponents may be right.

When one yells, the other should listen - because when two people yell, there is no communication, just noise and bad vibration.

### How to avoid making enemies

**You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself.**

Be wiser than other people if you can.

If a person makes a statement that you think is wrong - yes, even that you know is wrong - isn't it better to begin by saying:

ðŸš¨ **"Well, now, look. I thought otherwise but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if I am wrong, I want to be put right. Let's examine the facts."** - magical phrase.

Nobody will ever object to your saying: "I may be wrong. Let's examine the facts."

When we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. And if we are handled gently and tactfully, we may admit it to others and even take pride in our frankness and broad-mindedness. But not if someone else is trying to ram the unpalatable fact down our esophagus.

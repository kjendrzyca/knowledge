# How to win friends and influence people (based on the book by Dale Carnegie)

Donâ€™t criticize, condemn or complain.

Give honest and sincere appreciation.

## Arouse in the other person an eager want

You are interested in what you want. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we want. So the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.

If for example you don't want someone to smoke, don't preach them and don't talk about what you want;

We all started finger-painting on the kitchen table - my wife, Lil, my other son Bob, and myself, all having fun. Soon Tim was peeping around the corner. Next he was begging to participate. "Oh, no! You have to go to kindergarten first to learn how to fingerpaint."

If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own.

First, arouse on the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.

## To make people like you

### Become genuinely interested in other people.

You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.

### Smile.

### Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.

### Be a good listener

Sometimes be "hearty in approbation and lavish in praise".

People fail to make a favorable impression because they don't listen attentively. "They have been so much concerned with what they are going to say next that they do not keep theirs ears open.

Important people prefer good listeners to good talkers, but the ability to listen seems rarer than almost any other good trait.

### Encourage others to talk about themselves.

### Talk in terms of the other person's interests.

### Always make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely

Desire to be important is the deepest urge in human nature.

Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.

Express honest admiration for others hobby and interests to get something from them.

Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours.

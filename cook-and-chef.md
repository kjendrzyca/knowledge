# The Cook and the Chef

## Elon's Musk characteristics - based on Alex Vance book

- Nanomanaging - know every detail about his rockets
- When learning - develops tree trunk understanding
"if something requires inspiring words to be done, it is not worth doing"
- Generating ideas
  - What would be the best way to solve something?
  - Combine ideas from different industries
- He always proclaims the reasons for things
  - "I think we are about 8 to 10 years away from this being usable by people with no disability … It is important to note that this depends heavily on regulatory approval timing and how well our devices work on people with disabilities."
- He lives in the big picture, and his only lens is the maximum zoom-out. That’s why he’s such an unusual visionary. It’s also why he’s so worried.
- "Yes, but increasing bandwidth by orders of magnitude would make it better. And it’s directionally correct. **Does it solve all problems? No. But is it directionally correct? Yes. If you’re going to go in some direction, well, why would you go in any direction other than this?**"
- Hire only the best people fast and fire them fast if it doesn't work
- Know everything about everything in your company, know every detail

## [Musk's Secret Sauce](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html)

### APPLY LOGICAL REASONING TO EVERYTHING

- Flood geologists / scientist geologists
- Data and logic are far more effective tools than faith and scripture
- When it comes to most of the way we think, the way we make decisions, and the way we live our lives, we’re much more like the flood geologists than the science geologists.
- And Elon’s secret? He’s a scientist through and through.

### Hardware and Software

Human child vs Elon child:

- Human child: “I’m scared of the dark, because that’s when all the scary shit is gonna get me and I won’t be able to see it coming.”
- Elon child: “When I was a little kid, I was really scared of the dark. But then I came to understand, dark just means the absence of photons in the visible wavelength—400 to 700 nanometers. Then I thought, well it’s really silly to be afraid of a lack of photons. Then I wasn’t afraid of the dark anymore after that.”

Human single man vs Elon single man:

- Human single man: “I’d like to find a girlfriend. I don’t want to be so busy with work that I have no time for dating.”
- Elon: “I would like to allocate more time to dating, though. I need to find a girlfriend. That’s why I need to carve out just a little more time. I think maybe even another five to 10 — how much time does a woman want a week? Maybe 10 hours? That’s kind of the minimum? I don’t know.”

**MuskSpeak is a language that describes everyday parts of life as exactly what they actually, literally are.**

Having kids made him more comfortable with dying, because “kids sort of are a bit you. At least they’re half you. They’re half you at the hardware level, and depending on how much time you have with them, they’re that percentage of you at the software level.”

**People are computers. - Musk's thinking**

MuskSpeak can serve us well—because thinking of a brain as a computer forces us to consider the distinction between our hardware and our software, a distinction we often fail to recognize.

### Elon’s Software

#### 1. Software - Want Box

![software-want-box](/assets/software-want-box.png)

This box contains anything in life where you want Situation A to turn into Situation B. Situation A is currently what’s happening and you want something to change so that Situation B is what’s happening instead.

#### 2. Software - Reality Box

![software-reality](assets/software-reality.png)

All things that are possible.

#### 3. Software - Goal Pool

![software-goal-pool](assets/software-goal-pool.png)

The overlap of the Want and Reality boxes is the Goal Pool, where your goal options live.

So you pick a goal from the pool—the thing you’re going to try to move from Point A to Point B.

Examples:

- And how do you cause something to change? You direct your power towards it. A person’s power can come in various forms: your time, your energy (mental and physical), your resources, your persuasive ability, your connection to others, etc.
- The concept of employment is just Person A using their resources power (a paycheck) to direct Person B’s time and/or energy power toward Person A’s goal. When Oprah publicly recommends a book, that’s combining her abundant power of connection (she has a huge reach) and her abundant power of persuasion (people trust her) and directing them towards the goal of getting the book into the hands of thousands of people who would have otherwise never known about it.

#### 4. Software - Strategy Box

![software-strategy-box](assets/software-strategy-box.jpg)

Once a goal has been selected, you know the direction in which to point your power. Now it’s time to figure out the most effective way to use that power to generate the outcome you want—that’s your strategy.

#### Why this works for Musk so well? #elonsframework

##### Elon builds each software component himself, from the ground up.

- **reasoning from first principles**
- Examples
  - "I think generally people’s thinking process is too bound by convention or analogy to prior experiences. It’s rare that people try to think of something on a first principles basis. They’ll say, “We’ll do that because it’s always been done that way.” Or they’ll not do it because “Well, nobody’s ever done that, so it must not be good.” But that’s just a ridiculous way to think. You have to build up the reasoning from the ground up—“from the first principles” is the phrase that’s used in physics. You look at the fundamentals and construct your reasoning from that, and then you see if you have a conclusion that works or doesn’t work, and it may or may not be different from what people have done in the past."
  - In science, this means starting with what evidence shows us to be true. A scientist doesn’t say, “Well we know the Earth is flat because that’s the way it looks, that’s what’s intuitive, and that’s what everyone agrees is true,” a scientist says, “The part of the Earth that I can see at any given time appears to be flat, which would be the case when looking at a small piece of many differently shaped objects up close, so I don’t have enough information to know what the shape of the Earth is. One reasonable hypothesis is that the Earth is flat, but until we have tools and techniques that can be used to prove or disprove that hypothesis, it is an open question.”

##### Musk works through each of these boxes by reasoning from first principles.

1. Filling in the Want box
  - Filling in the Want box from first principles requires a deep, honest, and independent understanding of yourself.
2. Filling in the Reality box
  - Filling in the Reality box requires the clearest possible picture of the actual facts of both the world and your own abilities.
3. Goal selection from the Goal Pool
  - The Goal Pool should double as a Goal Selection Laboratory that contains tools for intelligently measuring and weighing options.
4. Strategy formation
  - And strategies should be formed based on what you know, not on what is typically done. (me: those could be the same things, but you need to verify that)

##### Elon continually adjusts each component’s conclusions as new information comes in.

In math:
- Given: A = B
- Given: B = C + D
- Therefore: A = C + D

In science:
- Given (it seems, based on what I know): A = B
- Given (it seems, based on what I know): B = C + D
- Therefore (it seems, based on what I know): A = C + D

**Hypotheses are built to be tested**. Testing a hypothesis can disprove it or strengthen it, and if it passes enough tests, it can be upgraded to a theory.

**So after Musk builds his conclusions from first principles, what does he do? He tests the shit out of them, continually, and adjusts them regularly based on what he learns.**

Let’s go through the whole process to show how:

You begin by reasoning from first principles to A) fill in the Want box, B) fill in the Reality box, C) select a goal from the pool, and D) build a strategy—and then you get to work. You’ve used first principles thinking to decide where to point your power and the most effective way to use it.

But the goal-achievement strategy you came up with was just your first crack. It was a hypothesis, ripe for testing. You test a strategy hypothesis one way: action. You pour your power into the strategy and see what happens. As you do this, data starts flowing in—results, feedback, and new information from the outside world. Certain parts of your strategy hypothesis might be strengthened by this new data, others might be weakened, and new ideas may have sprung to life in your head through the experience—but either way.

**=> Software - Strategy Loop:**

**Want box is a hypothesis**

**Reality box is a hypothesis**

Filling in your Reality box from first principles is a great challenge, and keeping the box current so that it matches actual reality takes continual work.

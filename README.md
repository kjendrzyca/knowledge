# knowledge

💡 Document everything

The idea came from [here](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/knowledge).

## the format

Compress the knowledge into directives. Based on [https://sivers.org/2do](https://sivers.org/2do).
Instead of taking regular notes, turn them into directives - actions.

Examples:

- “Eat only foods that will eventually rot.”
- “Avoid food products that make health claims.”

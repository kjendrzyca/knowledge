# SMART Goals

## Specific

Your goal should be as specific as possible. Name everything from who is involved, to what, where, when, and why you want to accomplish the goal.

## Measurable

Set milestone goals along the way to measure your progress, and know exactly how you’re going to measure your progress.

## Attainable

This is a biggie, and this step requires a bit of processing on your part. Is the goal you’ve defined actually attainable by you? What do you not have that you will need to get it done? Will you have the energy to achieve the goal? The focus? The time? The “attainability” of a goal is centered around you, and whether you have the focus, energy, time, and drive to achieve it.

## Realistic

You might be willing to put forth the effort into attaining the goal, but is it actually realistic? Just because you are willing to make it work, doesn’t mean it’s realistic. A goal being “realistic” is all about whether it’s possible to achieve it.

## Time-based

Time creates urgency, and your goal should be time-based. In other words, don’t just make a goal to lose 10 pounds, make a goal to lose 10 pounds over the next six weeks.

## Remember that working longer hours will make you more productive, but only in the short-run.

## Don't chat with co-workers or check email every 10 minutes. Spend half of time, but focus it on doing concrete task.

Just because you’re busy, doesn’t mean you’re productive.

## Produce and achive specific outcomes.

Just because you feel productive, doesn’t mean you’re productive.

When you multitask, you feel more productive than when you unitask, even though studies have shown time and time again that you’re not.

You feel more productive when you check your email 10 times an hour instead of writing a report, because you receive more feedback from what you’re working on. The better option is to produce and achive specific outcomes for who you work for.

## Schedule time where you completely separate from your work.

I think scheduling time where you completely disconnect from your work allows you the time and space to question the value of what you’re working on, so you can work smarter, and not just harder.

## Make plans to save yourselves time in execution

For every minute you plan, you’ll save 5 minutes in execution.

“Every minute you spend in planning, saves 10 minutes in execution.” - Brian Tracy

When you take a step back from your work and plan what to do instead of simply executing all of the time, you become more focused, and will find it easier to channel your time and energy into a few concentrated targets, making you much more productive.

When you simply hunker down and dedicate a lot of time to a task, I think it becomes very difficult to determine which targets you should focus on.

## To get more done in less time, schedule less time to do something.

The less time you schedule to complete a task, the more you push yourself to expend more energy over less time so you can get it done.

## Guard and nurture your energy levels at all times.

## Don't work long hours over long period of time.

Working long hours will drain your willpower reserves.

Don't ignore your mind when it tells you it's overworked.

## Make sure your todo list is actually doable.

One of the worst (and least productive) things you can do is be dishonest with yourself.

Is your to-do list doable, or do you keep putting things off to another day?

## Don't spend time on stupid shit.

Do you spend several hours on doing something stupid, and then try to forget about where your time went?

## Manage Expectations

I think one of the best skills you can develop is managing the expectations other people have of you.

When people know you won’t be available on evenings, weekends, or when you’re on vacation, you’ll reduce your stress and your overall workload.

And since breaks can make you so much more productive, it may even be better for your work in the end.

## Think big, act small

I think the key to becoming more productive is to just make one small change at a time. That may sound counterintuitive, but the reason for that is simple: the smaller the change you try to make to your life, the more likely you’ll actually make it.

## Don't ever multitask

Multitasking makes you less productive, and you should create strategies to resist the urge to multitask, like minimizing distractions and checking your email on a schedule.

According to a recent study, when you multitask, you are not being more productive - you just feel more emotionally satisfied from your work.

1. It makes you more prone to errors.
1. It actually takes longer.
1. It severely affects your performance.
1. It affects your memory.
1. It adds stress to your life.

What to do?

1. Only multitask with simple, habitual tasks.
1. Minimize distractions (instant messaging alerts, text message vibrations, email notifications, and so on).
1. Meditate.
1. Check your email on a schedule.
1. Know that your brain can’t actually multitask.
1. Music is a-okay.

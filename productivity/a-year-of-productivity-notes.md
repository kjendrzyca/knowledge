## Remember that working longer hours will make you more productive, but only in the short-run.

## Don't chat with co-workers or check email every 10 minutes. Spend half of time, but focus it on doing concrete task.

Just because you’re busy, doesn’t mean you’re productive.

## Produce and achive specific outcomes.

Just because you feel productive, doesn’t mean you’re productive.

When you multitask, you feel more productive than when you unitask, even though studies have shown time and time again that you’re not.

You feel more productive when you check your email 10 times an hour instead of writing a report, because you receive more feedback from what you’re working on. The better option is to produce and achive specific outcomes for who you work for.

## Schedule time where you completely separate from your work.

I think scheduling time where you completely disconnect from your work allows you the time and space to question the value of what you’re working on, so you can work smarter, and not just harder.

## Make plans to save yourselves time in execution

For every minute you plan, you’ll save 5 minutes in execution.

“Every minute you spend in planning, saves 10 minutes in execution.” - Brian Tracy

When you take a step back from your work and plan what to do instead of simply executing all of the time, you become more focused, and will find it easier to channel your time and energy into a few concentrated targets, making you much more productive.

When you simply hunker down and dedicate a lot of time to a task, I think it becomes very difficult to determine which targets you should focus on.

## To get more done in less time, schedule less time to do something.

The less time you schedule to complete a task, the more you push yourself to expend more energy over less time so you can get it done.

# A year of productivity - notes

Currently you can find the blog here: [https://alifeofproductivity.com/](https://alifeofproductivity.com/).

## Remember that working longer hours will make you more productive, but only in the short-run

## Don't chat with co-workers or check email every 10 minutes. Spend half of time, but focus it on doing concrete task

Just because you’re busy, doesn’t mean you’re productive.

## Produce and achieve specific outcomes

Just because you feel productive, doesn’t mean you’re productive.

When you multitask, you feel more productive than when you unitask, even though studies have shown time and time again that you’re not.

You feel more productive when you check your email 10 times an hour instead of writing a report, because you receive more feedback from what you’re working on. The better option is to produce and achieve specific outcomes for who you work for.

## Schedule time where you completely separate from your work

I think scheduling time where you completely disconnect from your work allows you the time and space to question the value of what you’re working on, so you can work smarter, and not just harder.

## Make plans to save yourselves time in execution

For every minute you plan, you’ll save 5 minutes in execution.

“Every minute you spend in planning, saves 10 minutes in execution.” - Brian Tracy

When you take a step back from your work and plan what to do instead of simply executing all of the time, you become more focused, and will find it easier to channel your time and energy into a few concentrated targets, making you much more productive.

When you simply hunker down and dedicate a lot of time to a task, I think it becomes very difficult to determine which targets you should focus on.

## To get more done in less time, schedule less time to do something

The less time you schedule to complete a task, the more you push yourself to expend more energy over less time so you can get it done.

## Guard and nurture your energy levels at all times

## Don't work long hours over long period of time

Working long hours will drain your willpower reserves.

Don't ignore your mind when it tells you it's overworked.

## Make sure your todo list is actually doable

One of the worst (and least productive) things you can do is be dishonest with yourself.

Is your to-do list doable, or do you keep putting things off to another day?

## Don't spend time on stupid shit

Do you spend several hours on doing something stupid, and then try to forget about where your time went?

## Manage Expectations

I think one of the best skills you can develop is managing the expectations other people have of you.

When people know you won’t be available on evenings, weekends, or when you’re on vacation, you’ll reduce your stress and your overall workload.

And since breaks can make you so much more productive, it may even be better for your work in the end.

## Think big, act small

I think the key to becoming more productive is to just make one small change at a time. That may sound counterintuitive, but the reason for that is simple: the smaller the change you try to make to your life, the more likely you’ll actually make it.

## Don't ever multitask

Multitasking makes you less productive, and you should create strategies to resist the urge to multitask, like minimizing distractions and checking your email on a schedule.

According to a recent study, when you multitask, you are not being more productive - you just feel more emotionally satisfied from your work.

1. It makes you more prone to errors.
1. It actually takes longer.
1. It severely affects your performance.
1. It affects your memory.
1. It adds stress to your life.

What to do?

1. Only multitask with simple, habitual tasks.
1. Minimize distractions (instant messaging alerts, text message vibrations, email notifications, and so on).
1. Meditate.
1. Check your email on a schedule.
1. Know that your brain can’t actually multitask.
1. Music is a-okay.

## Clear to neutral

Enter the idea of “clearing to neutral”. Clearing to neutral is a ritual where, “whenever you finish an activity, you [move] everything so [it] is in neutral position.”

## Be curious

Curiosity is the most powerful thing you own.

## Hire technology to do something for you

Hire Facebook to get in touch with your friends.

Hire Workflowy to make notes and ogranize your life.

Hire your girlfriend for companionship.

Understanding this allows me to focus more on things that are important, and less on things that aren’t when it comes to my relationship. It also points me in a direction where I should be investing my time and attention when it comes to my relationship.

Hire work to give me money for my time.

But I should hire my work to increase my programming skills and to make career!

## Precede Action with Intention

## Start with your values.

And if you don’t know them, look to your actions and work backward.

## Hook your productivity goals into your values

I can’t think of a better place for your goals to come from.

## Live intentionally

Every day, live intentionally, making sure you reflect on-the-fly how your actions are linked to your long-term productivity goals.

## Try to be happy

Achor has deeply explored the topic, and has uncovered that happy people:

- Are 31% more productive (this one’s my favorite)
- Have 37% better sales figures
- Have better, more secure jobs
- Are better at keeping their jobs
- Are more resilient
- Have less burnout

Recall three things you’re grateful for.

In Achor’s studies, after doing this for 21 days, people’s brains begin to “retain a pattern of scanning the world not for the negative, but for the positive first”, making them much happier.

### 1. Recognize where your happiness actually comes from.

- Invest your time and attention in what has been proven to actually make you happy.
- Don’t promise yourself more happiness only when you achieve more in the future.
- Lower your expectations of yourself, but aim high at the same time.

### 2. Continually try to become better at what you do.

- See your achievements as milestones, not endpoints.
- Define why you want to become productive in the first place. If you mindlessly try to become more productive without having a greater goal, how will
- you know when you’re successful, or if you’re focusing on the right things?
- Very deliberately pick what you want to get better at.

### 3. Take it easy on yourself!

## Journal one great experience you had

“Journaling about one positive experience you’ve had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it.”

## Exercise

“Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters”, and it helps you solidify the connection between your actions and their rewards. Exercise is also a great way to focus better.

## Meditate

“We find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we’ve been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once. It allows our brains to focus on the task at hand.”

## Perform a random act of kindness

It doesn’t matter if your act of kindness is buying a coffee for the person after you in line, volunteering, or sending a positive email. Achor gets “people, when they open up their inbox, to write one positive email, praising or thanking someone in their social support network.”

## Stop daydreaming and mind-wandering

Mind-wandering makes you less happy.

## Stay focused. Give you mind a relief. See yours thoughts from a perspectives

## Argue to learn

## Think about which people and activities provide you with the most energy, and then schedule time for them

## Focus on 'why' you do something, not 'what' you do

Apple communicates and focuses on why they make what they do before thinking about what they should actually make-they think about their “why” before they think about their “what”-and Sinek argues that this one of the main reasons they’re so successful.

Intention behind action is like wood behind an arrow, and by figuring out what truly motivates you, you’re going to become a lot more productive at the end of the day. The key is to “start with why”, and find tasks that are aligned with your values and who you really are.

# Choice-minimal lifestyle by Tim Ferris

1. Considering options costs attention that then can’t be spent on action or present-state awareness.
2. Attention is necessary for not only productivity but appreciation.

- Too many choices = less or no productivity
- Too many choices = less or no appreciation
- Too many choices = sense of overwhelm

## 6 Rules

There are 6 basic rules or formulas that can be used, regardless of denomination.

1. Set rules for yourself so you can automate as much decision-making as possible.
2. Don’t provoke deliberation before you can take action.

3. Don’t postpone decisions or open “loops,” to use GTD parlance, just to avoid uncomfortable conversations.
4. Learn to make non-fatal or reversible decisions as quickly as possible.
5. Don’t strive for variation—and thus increase option consideration—when it’s not needed. Routine enables innovation where it’s most valuable.
6. Regret is past-tense decision making. **Eliminate complaining to minimize regret**.

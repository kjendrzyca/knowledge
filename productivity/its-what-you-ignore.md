# It's what you ignore - Scott Hanselman

1. Scale yourself
  - "The less you do, the more of it you can do."
2. Do it , defer it, delegate it, drop it
3. Write things down to avoid psychic weight of the to-do things in your brain
4. Use The Rule of 3
  - 3 outcomes for the day
  - 3 outcomes for the week
  - 3 outcomes for the month
  - 3 outcomes for the year
5. Do work sprints
6. Use Pomodoro techniques
7. Everything important will find its way to you many, many times: don't worry if you miss it.
8. Remain in your flow: be wrapped up in the thing that has captured your attention.
9. Avoid multitasking
  - Make feasible multitasking eg. driving to work and listen to podcast, work out and watch series.
10. Let someone else guide. In any thing you need to learn, find a person who can tell you what is:
  - Need to know
  - Should know
  - Nice to know
  - Edge case, only if it applies tou you specifically
  - Useless
11. Ask a guy at local subway sandwiches - use aggregators
12. Find the right tools for your job
13. To cut sth you need to measure it
14. "If it's not helping me to make money, if it's not improving my life in some way, it's mental clutter and it's out." ~ Christopher Hawkings

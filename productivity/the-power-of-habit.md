# The Power of Habit - Charles Duhigg

## The Habit Loop

- cue
- routine
- reward

Bad habit cannot be cured, it needs to be replaced by a good habit.

## Changing bad habits

Awareness training - describe the cue, why do you do what you do.

Often we don't really understand the craving driving our behaviours until we look for them.

## Building a habit

**Belief** is crucial to make the habit consistent.

**Willpower** helps to develop new habits and change the old ones:

- willpower is not a skill - **it's a muscle**
- **it can be exhausted** - we need to reserve some willpower to do task after work - like running
- **it can be trained** like a normal muscle

### Training examples

- leaving chocolate bars lying around the house, so you have to resist them
- change a speech habit, by not using filler words like “umm” and “uhh,” or by no longer saying “like”
- using your left hand instead of your right hand for brushing your teeth, or using your computer mouse
- making a concerted effort to stop swearing

## Other notes

Sometimes crisis can be helpful to understand what habits are good and which should be changed.

Catastrophe can open your eyes, sometimes is better to watch it than let it die.

Music is interpreted by the same brain area that is associated with familiarity and patterns recognition.

Music is complicated so when we listen it, brain craves familiarity so we don't become distracted.

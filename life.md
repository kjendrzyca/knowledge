## Life purpose

### [Mark Manson – Life Purpose](http://markmanson.net/life-purpose)

- Do things you think are important in life.
- Embarrass yourself in order to achieve something.
- Do something useful for world - "save the world".
- Ask yourself - what would you do if you had to leave house all day?

### [Mark Manson – Surviving 20s](http://markmanson.net/surviving-my-20s)

- **Fail often** – reminder.
- Act on opportunities.
- Judge people not by who they are, but by what they do.
- Do a lot of small things because there is no such thing like overnight success.

### [Mark Manson – Dreams](http://markmanson.net/dreams)

- The reason not every fantasy should be pursued is because fantasies never have negative repercussions. Reality does.
- When you reach all your dreams there will be nothing more to do. You will be miserable.
- You need to follow your dreams BUT love the process because the process matters.
- That's why so many movie stars are starting to take drugs etc.
- Also that's why so many movie directors after achieving everything they wanted are no loger able to do good movies.

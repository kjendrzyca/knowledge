1. Everyone is offended all of the time.
2. If someone is offended by you, that’s because they’ve noticed you.
3. Not being noticed sucks more, but it’s a universal pain.
4. People will judge you, regardless of what you do, because everyone’s “judgy.”
5. Luckily, judgement & respect are different things
6. Self-respect leads to others respecting you.
7. Self-respect & entitlement are very, very different things.
8. If you don’t have their respect, you don’t need them.
9.  You really only need the people who respect and value you.
10. Confidence is achievable by the timid, introverted, or non-a-types.
11. Don’t give fucks like fucks are going out of style.
12. It’s okay to give a fuck about certain things.
13. Not giving a fuck is the opposite of apathy.
14. Greatness happens when you’re okay with being foolish/stupid.
15. Everyone is awkward, weird, different.
16. Refuse the boundaries of other people
17. Be honest about who you are and who you aren’t.
18. You can be honest without being a jerk.
19. The less you expect, the more accomplished you’ll feel.

### [Mark Manson – Life Purpose](http://markmanson.net/life-purpose)

- Do things you think are important in life.
- Embarrass yourself in order to achieve something.
- Do something useful for world - "save the world".
- Ask yourself - what would you do if you had to leave house all day?

### [Mark Manson – Surviving 20s](http://markmanson.net/surviving-my-20s)

- **Fail often** – reminder.
- Act on opportunities.
- Judge people not by who they are, but by what they do.
- Do a lot of small things because there is no such thing like overnight success.

### [Mark Manson – Dreams](http://markmanson.net/dreams)

- The reason not every fantasy should be pursued is because fantasies never have negative repercussions. Reality does.
- When you reach all your dreams there will be nothing more to do. You will be miserable.
- You need to follow your dreams BUT love the process because the process matters.
- That's why so many movie stars are starting to take drugs etc.
- Also that's why so many movie directors after achieving everything they wanted are no loger able to do good movies.
